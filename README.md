# Book-Scraper
Using Python

Web scraping software is defined as the tool used to supplement manual copy-and-paste labor done by humans to acquire massive amounts of data from websites.
Then the next step was to precise this research to a specific domain, so we took up the idea to scrape books from online sites. This idea was chosen as the book readers are sometimes so confused and bothered about what to study next, so to reduce their time in finding a suitable book we decided to scrape the books from demo site based on certain condition like Ratings, Cheap books etc. This gives the users a passage to rely on the process to make a decision of what should he choose next.

Implementation Steps are as follows:
          • Firstly, Getting an HTML file from a name using URLs of required web pages.
          • Searching for required information in that retrieved HTML file.
          • Storing the required information in various output formats.
