## Introduction
                        
These days there is a vast amount of data available on the Internet, which leads the user to have many different options to opt from. But this vast availability of data, mostly leads to confusion and hence fetching wrong information or the information which is of no use to the user, along with that the time invested in, to find the relevant source of fetching data is also a reason for concern. So to combat this situation of data retrieval from various online sources, Web Scraping is used.
